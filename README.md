# Movie-review-sentiment-analysis-using-Sagemaker

A simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

### Project

In this project i used Amazon Sagemaker to build, deploy and test the model and then i used Amazon S3 service to host my webpage so that i can share it with anyone on the internet.
[Sentiment Analysis Web App](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/Project) is a notebook and collection of Python files taken from the udacity . The result is a deployed RNN performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint.
